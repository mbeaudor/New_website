Ammonia is a key species in the atmosphere
playing a crucial role in forming secondary aerosols
and, thus, modifying the chemistry of the atmosphere.
Mainly from agricultural practices such as livestock excreta
and mineral fertilizer use, which vary worldwide,
ammonia emission quantification is not straightforward.
In addition, the volatilization process depends on
environmental variables (temperature, humidity, wind
speed) that make their estimation particularly complex.
Most global Chemistry Transport Models rely on
artificial-seasonal variation inventories, which can lead
to uncertainties in the representation of ammonia and
its related aerosols. My work takes part in this effort of
better estimating ammonia emissions from agricultural
practices at the global scale and study their impact on
atmospheric chemistry. Firstly, as a unique approach,
I suggest to include a new module (CAMEO; Calculation
of AMmonia Emissions in ORCHIDEE) dedicated
to agricultural ammonia flow within the global Land
Surface Model ORCHIDEE (Organising Carbon and
Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems). More specifically,
a representation of livestock feeding, manure management
chain, application of fertilizer (mineral and organic)
along with soil physical processes for volatilization
are developed and parameterized into ORCHIDEE.
Global agricultural ammonia emissions from CAMEO
reach 44 TgN yr−1 and the evaluation shows a highly
correlated seasonal cycle with IASI derived-emissions
(Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer). It results
from the response of ammonia emissions to environmental
changes (from land use and meteorology)
in CAMEO. The second step of my work consists in
exploiting CAMEO for future Shared Socio-Economic
Scenarios (SSPs; designed within the CMIP6 framework).
However, livestock densities, a key input data
for CAMEO are not available for the future in the literature.
Therefore, an original downscaling method is proposed
to retrieve future livestock densities at the gridcell
scale from 2015 to 2100 for three different SSPs. To
do so, Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) results for
the distribution of grassland and regional livestock production
trends are combined. CAMEO demonstrated a
possible range of agricultural ammonia emissions situated
between 50 to 70 TgN yr−1 in 2100, highlighting
the future intensive use of fertilizer (synthetic and
organic). Depending on the scenario and region, increased
livestock numbers can have a substantial role,
especially in Africa. The sensitivity of the future emissions
to climate has been tested and estimated at 15
to 20 %. Finally, the present-day and future ammonia
emissions from CAMEO have been prescribed to
the global Chemistry Transport Model LMDZ-INCA to
assess their impact on the atmospheric composition.
Present-day simulated ammonia columns were evaluated
against the IASI satellite observations and showed
a significant improvement in the spatial and temporal
variability compared to a reference simulation. Future
CAMEO emissions for a specific SSP (highest emission
scenario in 2100) were also tested under different
sulfate and nitrate emission conditions (relatively
high, low, and present-day levels). Independently from
the other emitted species levels in the future, the impact
of CAMEO emissions on the nitrate burden is crucial
and positive (+50 %). However, among the scenarios,
regional patterns are also observed in the surface
aerosol formation and the subsequent N deposition
fluxes. Knowing the bi-directional property of ammonia
at the interface between the atmosphere and biosphere,
I highlighted the importance of the coupling between
the two compartments around the nitrogen cycle within
the IPSL Earth System Model.
